<h1 align="center">Kartezio: Evolutionary design of explainable algorithms for biomedical image segmentation</h1>


**Kartezio** is a modular Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) framework that enables the automated design of fully interpretable image-processing pipelines, without the need for GPUs or extensive training datasets.  
Built on top of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), Kartezio empowers researchers, engineers, and practitioners to discover novel computer vision (CV) solutions using only a handful of annotated samples and a single CPU core.

Originally developed for biomedical image segmentation, Kartezio has been successfully showcased in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42664-x). Although it shines in medical and life science applications, Kartezio’s underlying principles are domain-agnostic.   
Whether you’re working with industrial quality control, satellite imagery, embedded vision, or robotics, Kartezio helps you craft custom CV pipelines that are **transparent, fast, frugal  and efficient**.

## Why you should try kartezio?

:nut_and_bolt:   **Modular and Customizable**  
   Kartezio is built from interchangeable building blocks, called **Components**, that you can mix, match, or replace. Adapt the pipeline to your project’s unique requirements.

:pencil2:   **Few-Shot Learning**  
   Forget the need for massive, annotated datasets. Kartezio can evolve solutions from just a few annotated examples, saving both time and computational resources.

:white_check_mark:   **Transparent and Certifiable**  
   Every pipeline produced is fully transparent. Inspect the exact operations used, understand their sequence, and trust the decisions made by your model.

:earth_africa:   **Frugal and Local**  
   Run everything on a single CPU, without GPUs or massive compute clusters. This makes Kartezio ideal for edge devices, embedded systems, or scenarios with limited computational resources.

:microscope:   **Broad Applicability**  
   While proven in biomedical image segmentation, Kartezio’s methods readily extend to other fields—like industrial machine vision, space imaging, drone footage analysis, or any custom image-based problem.

:books:   **Traditional Computer Vision**  
Kartezio offers a straightforward, interpretable way to learn and play with traditional CV filters. This makes it an excellent resource for **teaching and learning** about Image Processing fundamentals.
