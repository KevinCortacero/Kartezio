def kuwahara_filter(original, winsize):
    """
    Kuwahara filters an image using the Kuwahara filter

    Inputs:
    original      -->    image to be filtered
    windowSize    -->    size of the filter window: legal values are
                                                    5, 9, 13, ... = (4*k+1)
    This function is optimised using vectorialisation, convolution and the fact
    that, for every subregion
        variance = (mean of squares) - (square of mean).
    A nested-for loop approach is still used in the final part as it is more
    readable, a commented-out, fully vectorialised version is provided as well.

    Example
    filtered = Kuwahara(original,5);

    Filter description:
    The Kuwahara filter works on a window divided into 4 overlapping
    subwindows (for a 5x5 pixels example, see below). In each subwindow, the mean and
    variance are computed. The output value (located at the center of the
    window) is set to the mean of the subwindow with the smallest variance.

        ( a  a  ab   b  b)
        ( a  a  ab   b  b)
        (ac ac abcd bd bd)
        ( c  c  cd   d  d)
        ( c  c  cd   d  d)
